# svg-logo-generator

## Description 
This project allows me to dynamically create a custom SVG file quickly and efficiently by using a simple command-line application. Through my time working on this project, I honed in my knowledge of NodeJS and Node package managers. I also learned how to utilize test-driven development and object-oriented programming. Along with this, I used class constructors and learned the four pillars of object-oriented programming: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Usage 
To use this application, you must git clone this repository to your local computer. Navigate to the repository through the terminal. 
Once, you've done that, type in the following command to create your SVG:

```bash
node index.js
```

To run tests, type in the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Here is a video of me walking through the steps to use this application
